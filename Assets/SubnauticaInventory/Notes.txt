        InventoryViewController
            Pools, instantiates, and places ItemViewController prefabs
            
        ItemViewController - could break this into smaller components (item sprite controller, state manager, drag and drop behavior)
            Initialization:
                resizes itself
                sets sprite
            Controls interaction? (states + drag & drop)
                Hover state
                click state
                drag state
                drop-hover state
                drop action
                

    Item View Controller Interaction Logic:
        Implements IPointerEnterHandler
        Implements IPointerExitHandler
        Implements IPointerDownHandler
    
    Tooltip control:
        - Show when pointer enters - store pointer id
        - hide when pointer exits
        - use IpointerMove Interface to update position if pointer ID matches
        - if one pointer is using tooltip, the other can't hijack it
